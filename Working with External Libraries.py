This is a very challenging problem. Don't forget that you can receive a hint!

Luigi is trying to perform an analysis to determine the best items for winning races on the Mario Kart circuit. He has some data in the form of lists of dictionaries that look like...

[
    {'name': 'Peach', 'items': ['green shell', 'banana', 'green shell',], 'finish': 3},
    {'name': 'Bowser', 'items': ['green shell',], 'finish': 1},
    # Sometimes the racer's name wasn't recorded
    {'name': None, 'items': ['mushroom',], 'finish': 2},
    {'name': 'Toad', 'items': ['green shell', 'mushroom'], 'finish': 1},
]
'items' is a list of all the power-up items the racer picked up in that race, and 'finish' was their placement in the race (1 for first place, 3 for third, etc.).

He wrote the function below to take a list like this and return a dictionary mapping each item to how many times it was picked up by first-place finishers.'''
  
def best_items(racers):
    """Given a list of racer dictionaries, return a dictionary mapping items to the number
    of times those items were picked up by racers who finished in first place.
    """
    winner_item_counts = {}
    for i in range(len(racers)):
        # The i'th racer dictionary
        racer = racers[i]
        # We're only interested in racers who finished in first
        if racer['finish'] == 1:
            for i in racer['items']:
                # Add one to the count for this item (adding it to the dict if necessary)
                if i not in winner_item_counts:
                    winner_item_counts[i] = 0
                winner_item_counts[i] += 1

        # Data quality issues :/ Print a warning about racers with no name set. We'll take care of it later.
        if racer['name'] is None:
            print("WARNING: Encountered racer with unknown name on iteration {}/{} (racer = {})".format(
                i+1, len(racers), racer['name'])
                 )
    return winner_item_counts
